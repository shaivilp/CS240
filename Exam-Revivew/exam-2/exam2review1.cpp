Exam 2 Review Problem 1

A function named calculate takes two arguments: a double
that holds a sum, and an integer that holds a count. It
returns a double: a calculated average.

a) What is the function prototype?

b) What is a possible function header?

c) Write a calling statement for the calculate function
using the following declarations:

double average, total;
int numValues;
*/


#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;
/*

//a) What is the function prototype?
double calculate(double, int);

int main()
{

int numValues;

average = calculate(total, numValues);

return 0;
}
