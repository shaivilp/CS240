/*
Exam Review 5:
Assuming the following variables and code has been written, complete the code
by writing code that will verify that the lower bound is less than or
equal to the upper bound.

If the lower bound is too big, swap its value with the upper bound.

Make sure to declare any other variables that are needed.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
int lowerBd,   //holds the lower bound of the values
    upperBd;   //holds the upper bound of the values

//Get the lower and upper bounds from the user
cout << "What is the lower bound? ";
cin >> lowerBd;

cout << "What is the upper bound? ";
cin >> upperBd;
